A simple PHP web shell.

Malicious web shells are often uploaded to vulnerable web servers to allow the attacker access to system commands on the remote host via HTTP.

Abitrary file upload vulnerabilities are a common means of uploading a web shell.

This shell is using php's built in exec() function which allows you to call external programs / system commands. This is mainly for demo purposes. On production servers this function and similar dangerous functions will often be disabled via the disabled_functions directive in php.ini.
